🛍️ Myntra Clone – Frontend UI with HTML, CSS & JavaScript
📋 Description
This project is a frontend clone of the Myntra website, one of India’s largest fashion e-commerce platforms. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the clone mimics the user interface and layout of the original site. It focuses on clean design, visual appeal, responsiveness, and intuitive user interaction, ideal for showcasing frontend development skills.

This project includes key sections like the homepage banner, product categories, product grid cards, navigation bar, and footer. The clone maintains a pixel-consistent layout across different screen sizes and features hover effects, navigation links, and minor interactivity using JavaScript. It demonstrates a strong understanding of layouting techniques such as Flexbox and CSS Grid, and modular code organization using reusable components.

While it does not include backend or dynamic data, this project is perfect for demonstrating proficiency in frontend development and can serve as a solid template for building a complete e-commerce app with backend integration in the future.

✅ Steps to View

1. Download or clone this repository.

2. Move all image files from the images/ folder into the main project folder.

3. This is required because the image paths in the code assume the images are directly located in the root directory.

4. Open index.html in your browser.

5. That’s it! You now have a working static clone of the Myntra homepage.

📌 Note
Important: The image src paths in the HTML are currently hardcoded assuming that images are in the main folder. Please ensure you move all images from the images/ folder into the root directory of the project to make them visible properly.
